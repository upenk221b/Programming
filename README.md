Aim of this repository is to share code between my Linux and Windows platform
Follow these guidelines roughly while working on any projects :
As software developement tools are distributed on these two environment some specific projecs must be done on
specific environments.
Linux :
1.Data Science projects on Anaconda framework
2.Python OpenCv applications,Gui applications
AND python related web dev e.g on Django
3.c/c++
4.Shell Scripting

Windows:
1.Android developement (Flutter plugin for ios)
2.General web developement. (XAMPP)
3.Embeded C developement on MPLAB X IDE
4.bat files
5.Java applet,servelet,desktop application GUI etc. usig InteliJ IDEA
6.c/c++

#C-C++
    DataStructure liabrary is implements all DataStructures,search and sorting algorithms so the you don't need to write them explicitely.
    It is written in C because all C++ has STL liabrary support ,Java has collections , and python has plenty of inbuilt powerfull DataStructures.
    In this liabrary, All the files are written in C.So it can serve to C programs to speed up the developement.
