Notes to create desktop application from executables like comipled c,cpp,python scripts,java archive files etc.

1.create a executable(should run from command line ) which is preferably gui application.other wise creating desktop application will make no sense.

2.Once you have executable you need to create a small ".desktop" file in /usr/share/applications ,which will create a desktop shortcut.

3.the following format is self explanatory:

example.desktop
	[Desktop Entry]
	Name=Android Studio
	Comment=Android Studio
	Exec=/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh
	Icon=/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.png
	Terminal=false
	Type=Application
	Categories=Development
