*Haskell is a functional programming language it uses lambda calculus at its core
*lambda calculus and turing machines are two equivalent mathematical models
all the problems implemented on turing machines can be implemented using lambda calculus

why lambda calculus and functional programming
lambda calculus uses the most natural form for representing a given problem. As languages like haskell work on lambda calculus directly complex tasks can be programmed very easily

*Haskell uses GHC i.e. glasgow haskell compiler
	IT is-
	*native code generator compiler
